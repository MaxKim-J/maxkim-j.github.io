# Reminiscence

**Finally graduated from college,** where I've been a student for 8 years. It's been mostly cool, rather than frustrating. I wish I didn't belong to any school anymore.

**Weekly Tech Trends, a two-year tech meetup, is dead** We all have jobs now, so it's harder to find time on weekend mornings. We young techies who were in college, hungry for growth, are now becoming mature adults. I think that's a good thing.

**I shut down my 3-year solo project of a foreign bell clock** I was disappointed that I couldn't spend more time running it, but I also lost motivation to continue the project when I left college.

**The confidence I've gained at work has calmed me down a lot.** My anxiety and impatience have decreased so much that I've been able to think deeply about what makes me me, so I've been reading and writing my favorite texts rather than flogging myself with development studies for the first time in years.

**I mostly played alone** I became a master at playing alone, which made me think a lot about relationships. I saw a lot of friends I hadn't seen in a long time. I made the first initiative to meet a lot of people.

# Year in Review

## Feelings

**I realized that I can't live without other people.** Almost everything I've accomplished at work this year wouldn't have been possible without my coworkers. There were things I didn't want to lose this year, like the help and inspiration I got from the people who worked with me, or the feelings that came from the work that others wrote. Eventually, I came to the realization that I couldn't accomplish or feel much without others.

On the other hand, I used to think that I was a human being who didn't feel much of a blow when relationships were being broken and rebuilt, but I guess I wasn't, and I was suffering from a case of chill.

**I feel hopeful that I can reconcile with myself** I'm a self-loathing genius. I've always believed that getting into development was a way to find myself, but the truth is that even after I made a living at it, I killed a lot of parts of myself that I didn't like, parts that I didn't think people would like.

> "I thought I had accepted a lot of who I was, but I hadn't, and I had to get rid of a lot of things that were unique to me to become who I was. I wish I knew the parts of me that are gone, like a hand or foot that was cut off from my body." - September 12, 2022

Suddenly I must mourn the aspects of myself that I have killed. I need to accept them as lost. It was last year that I felt like I wanted to, but this year it feels like these aspects are coming back. They weren't dead.

Last year and this year, in the midst of my own struggles, my honest side came out, and I realized that maybe it's okay to stand there as the person I lost. Things like how I expect a lot, how I grieve a lot, how I celebrate a lot, how I live with an F instead of a T. I think I've become more honest with myself and others because I'm less covered up. I feel more at ease with what I say and do.

**I feel like I want to expand the world I can understand, and that feels like the purpose of life.** The moments that make me think differently and crack my routine, understanding something new, the person who made it, and the heart and intent behind it, feel like sparkles.

I feel like it's my job to cherish those moments, to keep coming back to them, to reach out to understand people, and I don't want to be shamelessly cynical and give up on understanding, even if sometimes the process is too difficult.

## Learning

At the beginning of this year, I started buying and selling stocks again after a long time. I paid for finviz, read books, and looked up reports and disclosures to build up my knowledge. It was great to be able to seriously study for the first time not just stocks, but the different asset classes that can be traded on the stock market and how to build a portfolio. As someone who has a very busy day job that doesn't allow me to spend a lot of time investing in stocks, the biggest accomplishment is that I have a better idea of how to make my investments sustainable going forward.

I've spent some time thinking about non-development posts on the blog, which has been a fun process, jotting down ideas as they come to me along the way and polishing them up in my iPhone's Notepad before bed. It's been both familiar and strange to me, coming from a time when I thought I could make a living from writing, a time that is long gone. I felt like I was meeting a part of myself that I thought I'd never see again, and I tried to gauge how far the sentences I was producing were from what I thought was good these days.

Next year, I would like to study more related to financial management, and I would like to practice reading and writing in English again, as I majored in English, but I am not good at it these days. I would also like to internationalize some of the articles on my blog.

## Exercise

I did 3 to 4 strength training sessions per week and ran 560 kilometers, just short of my goal of 600. My best 10 km run was 46:24 at a pace of 4:38 per km. I also played badminton with my coworkers. I lost a lot of body fat and gained about 2 kg of lean muscle mass, even though I weigh about the same. I have a pull-up bar and weighted dumbbells at home, as well as running and badminton equipment and shoes.

It's probably been the most athletic year I've ever had in my life, not because I had any physical goals, but because I'm an athletic mentalist and I do it for my mental health - dealing with uncertainty and complexity as part of my daily routine is a recipe for mental clutter. I've worked a lot this year, and it's probably because of exercise that I haven't had any fitness or health issues.

Next year, I want to run over 600 kilometers, run a 10-kilometer marathon, do 15 pull-ups in a standing position, and work out with a group rather than alone. I don't want to set a goal for my BMI because if I do that much exercise and eat less, I'll be in so much pain that I won't be able to practice my workout mentality.

## Reading.

I've started reading again, which is a category of books that I haven't read much since I started developing. I've been thinking a lot lately, "Why do people do what they do?" I've been reading brain science books about addiction and the nervous system to understand human behavior. I'm reading history books about Nazi Germany's Third Reich to understand people's past.

Most recently, I've been reading literature and prose. I read François Sagan's novels when I was in my twenties, and it's nice to read them again as I'm older and find them refreshing. I also find a lot of solace in the prose of The Wooden Garden.

**Books I read this year** : This is how Google engineers work / Your brain wants to optimize / Domain Driven Design at its core / What do cities live on / Dopaminergic / Ray Dalio's Financial Crisis Template Part 1 / Lift Off / Let the native language be silent / Micro Front Ends for the Modern Web / When it rains in Brazil, get rid of your Starbucks stock / Buy, sell, or earn / Love Brahms.... / Software Architecture 101 / The Pragmatic Programmer / We Become Our Own World / The Infinite Game / Never Apologize for Being Who You Are / Third Reich History (1) / Third Reich History (2) / How to Time Your Stock Investments Optimally / Compassion for Others / Signs of Defeat

## Consumption

I spent quite a bit of money filling the house I moved into late last year. I spent a lot of money on replacing the things I already had with better ones, because of the many options that disappeared when I moved from my college town to my current home. I feel like my quality of life has gone up a notch since I'm making more money compared to when I was in college, but the pitfall is that my spending has also gone up a notch.

Some of the purchases that I've been very happy with are the LG Whisen dehumidifier, LG monitor with WebOS, iPhone 14, and daylight bulbs. However, I've also had some major spending failures that have left me disillusioned with online purchases, especially clothes. It's so hard to get them to look like the real thing, but I can't be bothered to go out and buy them.

Next year, I'd like to make efforts to reduce consumption failures, such as making offline purchases through the hassle... And I think I need to be more intentional.

## Discover

I had a lot of fun going to places by myself that I would only go to in pairs or groups.

I went to the National Museum of Korea by myself and slowly wandered around the permanent exhibits while listening to electronic music. Deep house pom pom while watching the waterfowl.

Recently, I went to see two plays by myself (after reading Mokjungwon's post), and that was also great. It was refreshing to come home with my own impressions without thinking about whether other people were comfortable or agreed with the play. But Hannam-dong and Myeongdong are too far away, and I wonder why I didn't visit these places more often when I lived in Gangbuk, but I didn't have money then.

# Goals for next year

- Meet more new people. Find or create opportunities to meet them.
- Make time to study to write, read, and speak English
- Reduce spending failures and save more than I did this year

# Want to say.

- Even though I reached out to you (to people I haven't seen in a long time), you greeted me as if you had seen me yesterday. I felt like I was receiving hospitality I didn't deserve. Thank you so much. I hope to see you more often.
- (To those we've met often) Thank you for hanging out with me. I'll have more fun and talk less about development or the company.
- (To those who got married this year) I've been to a lot of weddings this year, and they've been bright and bubbly and pretty. I'm honored to have been invited and I wish them all a long and happy life.
- (To Red Velvet) Thank you so much for making a comeback.

(End)
