I recently left a 14-month stint as a front-end developer at two startups and went back to school this semester, spending the first six months as a credit-bearing school work placement and the remaining eight months working full-time at a seed-stage startup. Here's a brief retrospective of my time at the company.

I'm a senior in college and will graduate next year. I started working in development for the first time in early 2019, so I've been getting paid for development for a little over two years now. I have experience in outsourced development, personal projects, and working for companies.

# Why I delayed graduation and started working for a company

- I started late in development, so I absolutely needed more time to learn and study development before I graduated. I didn't have the confidence to go into my senior year as it was.
- I wanted to know if working at a startup was a good fit for me. I thought working at a startup would be the fastest way to find out. I also wanted to give myself enough time to figure out what kind of company I liked and what kind of work environment I liked.
- To do this, I came up with a rough plan - why not try two organizations in a year?
- I wanted to save some money and graduate.

# Companies I worked for

## First company (6 months)

I was hired as an intern for a semester as part of my school fieldwork.

It was a global chatbot solution startup operating in China and Korea, and not only chatbot but also SI across the web. I decided to join the company because they had about 15 developers in the series A stage, and there was a third-year gunner who I could definitely watch and learn from. At that time, I wanted to meet a real gunner so badly.

I developed the front-end of the company's own commerce and SI projects for large and mid-sized companies using Vue.js.

I think my biggest gain was the experience of collaborating with so many different actors within the company. I worked with PMs, planners, designers, backend developers, fellow frontend developers, Chinese developers from the company's Shanghai office, and people from large enterprises (client-side), and I kept thinking about how to communicate and collaborate. Speaking English is a must... I even made the decision that one day I would take the time to study it.

When I joined the company, I was working in an office inside a large corporate building, so I was able to experience indirectly how a large organization works and how people who work in large companies work. I think that was a good experience for me, since I had no corporate experience.

I created an NPM library for efficient development, and just before I left, I created a front-end internal wiki.

## Second company (8 months)

At my first company, I worked on a lot of SI projects, which meant that my impact on the business as a subcontractor developer was obviously limited to what the client asked me to do, and as a subcontractor developer, my impact on the business was negligible. This whetted my appetite and made me want to try my hand at working in a smaller team where I could be more involved in decision-making.

The second company is a seed-stage startup that provides a fashion pre-order platform. The platform attracts designers who want to create fashion products and matches them with consumers in the form of pre-orders. I led a 3-person front-end development team despite my lack of skills, which I think was possible because it was a very early stage team.

As my responsibilities and roles increased, I had to think about design, component structure, health management methods, deployment automation, mobile app development, and more. I kept thinking about the fear of maintaining a live service, the carefulness required, and how to collaborate and develop efficiently in an early startup with rapidly changing requirements. I didn't do a good job because I was a junior, but I also had the opportunity to think about how to make developers work well together and grow together.

I learned to swim with my feet on the ground. Being an early development team with no seniority, I didn't know if my judgment was really sound or if we were on the right track, so I was constantly studying and researching. Along the way, I gained a little bit of confidence that even without a gunner (although I wish I had one), I could learn and master things on my own and contribute to the product.

It's a shame that I didn't get to do everything I had planned, but I think it was rewarding to see the service grow in such a short period of time. I hope the Series A investment goes well,,,

My coworkers were really great people. It was an energetic startup with a lot of love for the team and eagerness to see it grow.

# Reasons for leaving.

The main reason I left was that I wanted to graduate from university sooner rather than later and have more freedom in terms of my status.

Secondarily, I wanted to take some time to study on my own and get back into the job market. As a non-major, I don't have a lot of CS knowledge, and I felt that I needed more time to organize the knowledge that I didn't really understand because I was building products quickly.

Of course, I could have continued working, but I like to do something when I feel like I'm ready for it. Being the person that I am, I also thought that maybe the last time I'm in school before graduation is the last time I'll be able to study at my own pace and on my own terms.

# Feelings

## The 'me' at work

It goes without saying, but I've never experienced "me at work" before. It made me think about how I like to work and what a good work environment looks like for a developer.

In a startup, you don't have a rigid work structure, so I think it's been fun to try out new ways of working that are possible in a startup and figure out the most efficient way to do things.

## Just a developer, not a front-end developer

In addition to web front-end development, I've been exposed to mobile app development, infrastructure design, and CI/CD implementation, and I've realized that I'm not just a front-end developer. I've learned a lot of different skills by doing things.

Just because you're a front-end developer doesn't mean you're going to be doing only front-end in a company, especially if it's a small company. I realized that as a developer who builds software, you need to know the basics of building software so that you can learn quickly and produce a certain level of quality in any given task.

I also felt that having a good understanding of what's going on in the development team was essential for team productivity and effective discussions. The front needs to understand the backend and infrastructure too. The learning never ends and there seems to be nothing you don't know in the development world.

I don't want to say, "I can't do this," or "I don't know that." I don't want to say, "I don't know this. I don't want to be a front-end developer, I just want to be a developer.

## I'm too junior to lead a team yet

I'm a junior developer, still thirsty for growth. But in my second company, I was in a position to lead the front team. Here's the disconnect: I didn't take care of the team very well.

I wasn't maximizing the productivity of the team as a whole. When it came to work distribution, I wanted to do the things I wanted to do, the things that would allow me to grow. I wanted to do things that would help me grow, rather than devising a work distribution that worked for the team and not me. I wasn't thinking about the team's productivity first.

I didn't really get to know my teammates' abilities and think, "Hey, if I give this task to this person, they'll be able to grow more." I didn't do things like study together so that the whole team could grow. I think I just shared a couple of articles a couple of times that were technical things that I wanted other people to know.

I'm a junior, so maybe that's an excuse, maybe I'm not seeing the big picture, maybe I'm just not good enough. I really want to be a developer who can take care of the team, who can grow with the team, who can grow with the team as I gain more skills and experience. I apologize to my teammates in many ways...

## Early startups are comfortable with juniors in a bad way

Early-stage startups have a very difficult time hiring talented developers. The company keeps its eyes low, and it's relatively easy to hire inexperienced junior developers if you can get the job done right away.

Early-stage startups are more concerned with rapid feature expansion and quick products to showcase than solid design of the software for immediate growth. Even if you solve a problem in a way that doesn't look good for the future, as long as it's solved, it's a job well done for the team and the company. You don't have seniority, so you don't know up front if this was a good way to do things. You only realize you're doing it wrong when something goes wrong.

Of course, you can grow through trial and error. But if the cycle is too slow, and worst case scenario, you don't explore the way you do things or the technology, you just keep doing things the way you've always done them, and then there's no growth, and you think that somehow you're doing a good job at the company because you're doing things the way you've always done them. It may be a lot of work, but you're doing it in a similar way, so it's comfortable.

From this perspective, I don't think early-stage startups are a good place for junior developers. You can't grow as fast as you can be broken, so I think it's really important for a junior in an early startup to take the initiative to learn, and to constantly look for better ways to do things than the design or code you've done.

I don't know if I did a good job, I kept studying and validating, but if you ask me if I gave 100%, I'm not sure. I keep thinking that if I didn't do that at the time, if I should have applied something sooner (I'm a very timid and futon-kicking person), so I just need to keep studying and validating wherever I can.

## Developing for 'me' and the company

As I mentioned in the paragraph above, early startups are more concerned with scaling features and delivering results quickly than they are with solid software. Even if I wanted to make structural improvements or refactor, I often found that the CTO or development team leader wouldn't allow me to grab a task and work on it in a sprint because they had other higher priority things to do faster.

While I understood the situation at hand, I was frustrated, partly because it was clear that if we continued to add features to this structure, development productivity would suffer. The other reason was that I wanted to grow by adapting what I thought was a better structure.

What I was able to do was to make very slow, incremental improvements. When I was working on a particular feature, I would refactor it in such a way that I would apply the improved structure in very small increments. Or I'd take time to refactor while I was working on something else, like doing a little bit more work.

In retrospect, I realize that refactoring was beneficial for the company, but it was also for me. I gave myself a plan so that I could experiment with better structures, improve the product, and grow as a result.

Of course, I'm grateful to my company for allowing me to refactor in this way in the midst of all the other things I have on my to-do list. If you have a structural improvement you want to make, I think it's a good idea to propose a refactoring or structural improvement to your company in a way that will help the company grow. Of course, it has to be obviously beneficial to the company as well as to you, and the task has to be acceptable to the company.

## Startups are an uncomfortable and cutthroat labor scene

Before I experienced corporate life firsthand, there was something a bit romanticized about startups. You know, like climbing on a rocket and experiencing insanely fast growth.

But by the time I joined my second company, it was going through its first death valley (...)

The company atmosphere wasn't great, a lot of people were leaving, the numbers weren't going up fast enough, we weren't seeing growing metrics, it was more of a point where we were investing to grow metrics, the development team was having to create new products within deadlines that were ridiculous in hindsight, and they were getting burned out.

After 4-5 months of that, the company started to grow again: we had more designers coming to us, and the number of projects we were opening was at an all-time high. It wasn't a J-curve, but it was enough to get us out of a plateau and back on track, and by the time I left, we were looking for a Series A investor.

I realized that in order to build a rocket that grows, you have to struggle as well. It seems like every moment of a startup can't be growth. I also realized that there's always a deficit, and that you have to maximize the resources you have and try to grow a little bit to move up. Along the way, people suffer a lot.

I realize that this can be an unbearable work environment for some people. It's uncomfortable and intense. For me, though, it was a very challenging environment and I think I learned a lot from it, both inside and out. I think I would definitely come back to work at an early stage startup again someday, but with a little more experience + skills.

#closing remarks

Looking back on my 14 months at the company, I feel like I've experienced and learned a lot in such a short time, and I still have a long way to go. I want to continue to build my skills and learn so that I can become a developer who is useful to both the team and people in my future organization.

I would like to thank everyone who has worked with me. I've learned a lot and become a better developer because of them. I wish you all the best and success!
