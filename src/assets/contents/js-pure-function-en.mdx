When you were learning React, you were taught that `state` should be **immutable**, and when you were learning Redux, you were probably introduced to the concept of **pure functions**. There's a difference between knowing what these concepts are and building an app that doesn't.

By considering side effects and function purity, you can write functions that do the same thing in any
situation and don't interfere with the work of other functions. In a collaborative situation, you don't
want someone else's function to interfere with yours. or interfere with your own function in a collaborative
situation? To write better JavaScript code, understanding pure functions to write better JavaScript code.

## Side effects and pure functions

So, first of all, what are side effects? A side effect is an effect or side effect that is different from the purpose for which the function was created. To put it more simply, if a function has the potential to do something unexpected, then it's a function that can have side effects.

A function without side effects is a "pure function" and a function with side effects is an "impure function".

```javascript

// Functions that send HTTP requests: can't be pure functions
const getData = () => {
  axios.get('http://data.url')
  .then(...)
  .catch(...)
}

// Input-implied functions: can't be pure functions
const typeInput = () => {
const input = prompt("Message");
  return input;
}

// function to directly change parameters: can't be a pure function
const changeParams = (arr, elem) => {
  arr.push(elem);
  return arr;
}
```

A function can't be pure if **something unexpected** can happen inside or outside the function. A function that sends asynchronous requests has the potential for the request to fail. Functions that take inputs can't be pure functions either, because there's a chance that the output will depend on the input.

Functions that directly modify values passed in as parameters also can't be pure functions, because if you modify a referenced data type object, such as an array, directly inside a function, it can affect the behavior of other functions that take it as an argument later. We'll explain this in more detail later.

While the term impure function may have a negative connotation, it's not necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes you need side effects, like in asynchronous HTTP requests.

## Pure functions that don't change parameters directly

You can create a pure function simply by avoiding directly changing the values that go into the parameters of your function. The reason for avoiding direct manipulation of parameters is that we don't know **what else this parameter might be used for**.

If a function directly changes the value of a parameter, the changed value will persist and can affect the behavior of other functions. Consider the code below.

```javascript
const num_arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Impure function that directly changes the value of a parameter
const addSixImpure = (arr) => {
  // add 6 directly to the parameter
  arr.push(6);
  return arr;
};

// Pure function that changes the value of a parameter copied from it
const addSixPure = (arr) => {
  // add 6 to a new array with the expand operator
  newArr = [...arr, 6];
  return newArr;
};

// Function to check if the parameter arr has 6 in it
const hasSix = (arr) => {
  if (arr.includes(6)) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
};

const new_arr = addSixImpure(num_arr);
console.log(hasSix(num_arr)); // true
```

At first glance, `addSixPure()` and `addSixInpure()` don't look much different, but `addSixInpure()` is an impure function that changes the value of a parameter directly, while `addSixPure()` is a pure function that copies the value of a parameter and changes it.

Because `addSixInpure()` directly replaces `num_arr`, when the function runs, the value of `num_arr` is permanently changed to `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`, so the result of the `hasSix()` function is true.

However, if the developer's intention was to assign a new array to the variable `new_arr` after calling the `addSix` function, and then determine whether `num_arr` with the value `[1,2,3,4,5]` has sixes in it, the code didn't work as intended. The result should be `false` because `num_arr` has already changed.\*\* So in this case, the `addSix` function shouldn't directly change `num_arr`. Instead, we need code like this

```javascript
const new_arr = addSixPure(num_arr);
console.log(hasSix(num_arr)); // false
```

Because `addSixPure()` does not directly manipulate `num_arr`, the value that was initially assigned to `num_arr` is unchanged. Therefore, the result of `hasSix(num_arr)` is `false`.

This example illustrates that **the more pure functions you have, the more predictable your code will be**. The result of `hasSix()` is incorrect because `addSixInpure()` had the **side effect** of adding 6 to `num_arr`. The less we manipulate the declared variables directly, the more likely functions will behave as the developer intended without side effects.

## Wrapping up

Pure functions can be useful and are often used in practice. React state avoids side effects by avoiding direct manipulation. The `reducer` in `Redux` must be a pure function because functions that change the value of `store` must not have side effects, so that the values inside `store` are safe.

Pure functions are also easier to test because they always guarantee the same output for the same input, which is a key concept in functional programming... I feel like I've only scratched the surface with this post, so I hope I can post about the benefits of pure functions in practice.
