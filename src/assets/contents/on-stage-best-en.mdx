Since OnStage is going away, I thought it would be a good idea to take a look at some of my favorite videos and try embedding them on the blog.

There were some that I kept listening to no matter what, and some that I liked so much that I didn't revisit. Nowadays, the failure rate has dropped due to the algorithm, so it's harder to get a bad first impression.

I picked 10 of my favorites or the ones I kept coming back to. I sorted them in order of age. I don't rate them, of course, but I organized my impressions. My taste in music was always more towards modern rock and I rarely listen to hip-hop. As I sorted them, I realized that I was gradually moving towards electronic music.

Some of the songs I chose because I just like the music, some because of personal memories, and some because of the image and production of the stage.

Antifreeze has a good tumbling mood, and the way it's recorded in this video really shows it. Maybe it's the candlelight, but I've often thought of this song as a folk song that could be played at a rally of my fellow activist contemporaries.
this stage.

I snuck this on my cell phone in high school during midnight snooze. I think it has the most beautiful lyrics of any Korean song I know. The purple curtains and pin lights, along with Yoon Sung-hyun's distorted face, make the video hard to forget.

I love on-stage footage set outdoors this time of year. People stare and duck as he blows the blues over the sound of a bus passing by the cell phone store down the street. Now that I think about it, it was raining...

The cuts are very distracting, jumping from here to there, compared to the calm mood, but it's also in sync with the song, which creates a kind of danceable angst. I don't know if the crackling when the camera moves is wrong or intended. It's questionable in many ways.

Traveling to a cave to film live... I love it. I was telling everyone around me that it was a video that would kill me. Now I see that Mr. Kim Okie is playing the saxophone.

I was torn between 9 and SISTER, but I chose SISTER because it has a lot of shots of the whole band from a distance, from above, so that the camera can catch them. I remember coming home drunk and watching it on my phone and not knowing what to make of the band, the lyrics, the off-color lights, the sandy beach, but I knew it was shit.

I've thought a lot about people singing to electronic music in plants. The music is artificial and extreme, the greenery is harmonious, and the onstage lighting is good.

Kim's immobility while rapping fits nicely into the cube that emerged during this period. At first, I understood it as a mix and match, but her static, calm demeanor fits well with the complex, cold beats and raps.

It's a song with very few sounds, and it's so well delivered that by the time you're done listening to it, you feel like you're floating. It's a song about being near death. The dark, bright, and then dark again sequence is so fitting.

I recall a comment estimating his age when he was choreographing with silent labor, looking like he wanted to hold your hand but didn't want to hold it at all. Onstage with precious choreography. See also [Ulhee Aekhee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cNJJaVqWc&list=RDa8cNJJaVqWc&start_radio=1).
