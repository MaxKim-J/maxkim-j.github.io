I've been thinking about and writing down the kind of developer I am and the kind of developer I want to be for future opportunities and choices.

## Front-end developer who loves engineering

While I believe that the frontend exists for user experience and interface, I also believe that it is important to make the client product a more reliable and bug-free machine.

I think I'm just as interested in designing for state management, performance, and bug reduction as I am in UI/UX, which is often overlooked because it's all about the visible product.

Front-end products are highly dependent on the back-end, design modifications, and can be modified for a myriad of reasons. You need to create a product with a structure that is easy to modify and extend. It's still too hard and I'm not sure how to do it, but I want to keep exploring how to make a good machine through trial and error.

I'm also interested in UI/UX because I think it's something that designers and planners work together to create, but the internal aspects of the product are the sole responsibility of developers.

## Service developer who likes to think about the big picture of a service

I've never really thought about what company I want to work for or what I want to be in a few years, but I recently started thinking about becoming a CTO.

It's fun to understand a service from the front to the back and figure out what parts impact the business. I'm still interested in learning other areas of development like backend and infrastructure as well as client development, so I've been dabbling a bit.

I've found that building an entire service while still working on my own projects is more fun than developing a specific area.

At the moment, I think I want to be more of a generalist than a specialist, but I believe that software development has something in common regardless of the field, and I want to be a developer who has the ability to perform at a certain level by studying any field.

## developer who wants to be a seeker on the keyboard

I've thought about it a lot, and I don't have a lot of personal and materialistic desires. I don't want to make 100 billion, buy a nice house or car, etc. I don't really know what else I need to get, as long as I feel like I'm worth something and don't feel poor.

I just want to live freely and not be tied down, and I want to study technology and seek truth.

I like programming in the sense that it's the act of building a machine. A machine should be rigorous and able to work in any situation, but the complexity of the machine itself makes it harder to achieve rigorous and precise behavior the bigger it gets.

I think that by honing the skill of building machines that perform rigorous and precise behaviors in the face of exponentially increasing complexity, we can understand the complexity of the real world a little bit better. I see studying development and technology as a way to explore how things work.

Rather than continuing to develop and learn to be better than others or to acquire material things, I want to continue to learn because I want to be humble in the face of technology with its near-infinite complexity and understand with my mind and body how to understand the world.

## Developers who want to contribute to a better world

In Buddhism, there is a concept of impermanence.

It means that nothing is fixed. All phenomena are created and destroyed at any given time and are always changing, and I think the reason for this is that countless phenomena are created by countless other phenomena in a causal chain. Every phenomenon in the complex world has a chain of causation that creates phenomena and changes everything. I think that's a pretty scientific insight into the world around us.

I meet a lot of people I don't even know through the code I write and the products I make, and I think that if I can bring convenience and meaning to those people, I can start a relationship that can change the world for the better.

I owe a debt of gratitude to a lot of people I met in my early twenties when I was in student organizations and doing activism and stuff like that. At the same time, I thought that while organization and solidarity are necessary for progress, technology can change the world more steadily and directly than people's hearts and determination.

I want to be where I am, honing what I can, and contributing more to a world where many people suffer less and live with more understanding than they did yesterday.
