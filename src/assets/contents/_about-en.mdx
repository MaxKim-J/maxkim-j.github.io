I have been making a living through software development for several years. I am deeply interested in addressing complex problems in various dimensions of personal life, society, and engineering. I often contemplate about community and desire a world where the weak do not perish. I majored in English literature.

I enjoy reading and writing, theater, photography, studying investments and finance, running 5-10km, K-pop, and fragrances.
